# Idea to MVP with AI - Hands On  

Now, let's build something with Townie AI!  

## Building a Job Posting & Public Chat App  

Let's say we want to create an app that allows users to post job listings and have a public chat room for discussions. We can prompt Townie AI to generate this functionality.  

### Prompt:  
> **Create an app that allows users to post job postings and have a public chat room to talk about opportunities.**  

### Step 1: Require Usernames for the Chat Room  

To ensure a structured chat, we can prompt Townie AI with:  
> **Require users to input their name before posting in the chat room.**  

### Step 2: Testing Job Postings  

Once generated, posting a job should display the listing below the **"Post Job"** button.  
- Copy the link from the preview section and open it in a different window.  
- If the job posting appears, it means we have persistence and a working full-stack app. âœ…  

### Step 3: Debugging the Chat Feature  

While testing the chat functionality, it might not work immediately. To debug:  
- Click on the **"Logs"** button at the bottom of the preview.  
- Review the error message.  
- Copy the message into the chat so Townie AI can suggest a fix.  

### Step 4: Fixing the Chat Feature  

Once fixed, the chat should work! ðŸŽ‰  
- Try using two different users and see their messages appear in real-time.  

### Step 5: Improving the UI with Tabs  

To enhance navigation:  
- Modify the layout to use **tabs** for better switching between the **Public Chat Room** and **Job Postings**.  

### Step 6: Expanding Functionality  

You can now add more features and customizations to enhance your app! ðŸš€
